# Machine-Learning-Classifier-for-Glioma-Diagnosis
This project is based on the theory that the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) classification model is the best option for creating a classifier. The model is then optimized by switching to Random Forest.
The dataset used in this project displays the twenty most frequently mutated genes and three clinical features derived from the TCGA-LGG and TCGA-GBM brain glioma projects.
The datasets were provided by the International Journal of Molecular Sciences:

Tasci, E., Camphausen, K., Krauze, A., & Zhuge, Y. (2022). Glioma Grading Clinical and Mutation Features [Dataset]. UCI Machine Learning Repository. https://doi.org/10.24432/C5R62J.
