# Machine-Learning-Classifier-for-Glioma-Diagnosis
The purpose of this project is to create a binary classifier capable of distinguishing between two types of gliomas: lower-grade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). This classifier uses variables based on histological and imaging criteria of a patient and has an accuracy of 89.52%.
